# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 'Deep Learning with PyTorch' lesson of 'Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge' course, which is lesson 2 out of 10 lessons (Lesson 1 is actually nothing but a welcome lesson).

**Thoughts** I've refreshed my knowledge and learned new stuff throughout the lesson. It was really interesting!
